# Future ideas

## optional stuff

- [ ] to use redux instead of that experimental stuff
      it is quick to add state in the current system
      but there are small things that react-redux should be able to handle
      also event bus can be useful here and there
- [ ] there are other old experiments artifacts
- [ ] handle audio in the main electron process and not in html audio
      if it changes anything

## very optional stuff

- [ ] react dnd is outdated, there was a couple of breaking updates
- [ ] look into nested sub-boards
- [ ] look into attaching audio to images
- [ ] look into old ideas, select/organize them somewhere
- [ ] handle z-indexes ordering for content
