# Info

Activity log:
Log of things I try here.
It is not a todo list. This one is append-only.
Git log is not my thing somehow.
This one is more prescriptive.
Orgfile seems to be used for other stuff now.
Maybe I will integrate this log into it.
But maybe I like vim too much.
Started: *2019*.

Decisions:
Stuff that has interesting alternative paths but is fixed.
