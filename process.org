* process and tools
- [X] two step TDD
- [X] usage scenario
- [X] watir for e2e scenarios
- [X] unit tests using default create-react-app way
- [X] react + baobab + materail-ui
- [X] styled-components as a conservative choice
- [ ] try linaria later and see if you can preprocess for better syntax!
      see if it is ok to use it near material-ui
- [ ] try react-window for new entries list
* meta
** DONE is storybook relevant? - yes - for layouts
this BDD approach seems to make it less useful to have storybook
because I develop incomplete vertical paths and not trying stuff in units

* [2/8] main scenario
** DONE [2/2] user uploads a directory with mp3 files
*** DONE e2e test
*** DONE [6/6] code
- [X] user uploads directory
- [X] get new architectural idea
- [X] old code -> trash
- [X] define some structure & domain
- [X] enter the cycle
- [X] test passes
** DONE refactoring?
** TODO ui part
** TODO user sees buttons that play sounds
** TODO user sets positions of buttons by dragging
** TODO user saves changes as a file into the same directory
** TODO after page reload: user loads that directory and positions
** TODO user can assign positions for newly added files
